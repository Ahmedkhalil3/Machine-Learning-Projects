# Machine Learning Projects Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of **machine learning and data science projects** developed to demonstrate practical skills in data analysis, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

Each project is self-contained and follows a structured, reproducible workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance assessment. The repository reflects progressive learning and increasing project complexity.

---

Each project directory includes:
- A Jupyter notebook with the full analysis
- A `requirements.txt` file for reproducibility
- A dedicated `README.md` describing the project

---

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- SQL / SQLite
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Purpose of This Repository
This repository serves as:
- A **learning portfolio** documenting applied machine learning practice
- A **reference** for structured end-to-end ML workflows
- A **showcase** for academic and entry-level data science opportunities
