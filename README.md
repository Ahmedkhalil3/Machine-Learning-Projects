# Machine Learning Projects

A collection of end-to-end machine learning projects covering data analysis, modeling, validation, and evaluation, with a focus on practical and well-structured workflows.

## Overview
This repository is for all of my machine learning projects. Each project follows a complete workflow, starting from data exploration and preprocessing, through model development, and ending with evaluation and conclusions.

## Contents
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Machine learning and statistical modeling
- Time-series forecasting projects
- Model evaluation and validation

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to build a professional portfolio of applied machine learning projects and to practice solving real-world problems using structured and reproducible approaches.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- statsmodels
- matplotlib

More projects will be added over time.
